  ## Description
  
  This application will create a profile page for a team using inquirer.  In the console, the user is prompted to enter information for the team.  Every team needs a manager, so the first input will be a manager.  After the manager is entered the user is prompted if they want to add additional employees or finish creating the team.  From this menu, the user can add as many engineers and interns as they would like by selecting the term from the choices and following further prompts.  The result is a new HTML page being written in the dist folder which displays the team profile page.
  
  ## Installation
  
  Simply download the files and open the folder in visual studio code.

From there, follow the prompts in the console to create your team!  Start by adding a manager, then add as many engineers and interns as necessary.  Finish entering team members by selecting the 'Create team profile' option from the menu.  After using this option, look for your new HTML page in the /dist folder.
